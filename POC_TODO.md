- Add images for needed ladder symbols?
- Plan out more detailed layout
- Cursor?
- Grid lines?

Try line drawing
May use bevy_prototype_lyon and svgs later

  - [ ] Output actuators
  - [ ] Input sensors




- [ ] Simple momentary circuit for lights
- [ ] Actuator puzzle should be impossible without the light, but easy with

- [ ] Force latching
- [ ] Add sensors that can be used

- [ ] Force completion with help of sensors
  - [ ] Possible reasons
    - [ ] Sensor senses more than camera
    - [ ] Reaction time
    - [ ] User input limit, such as needing their outputs for something else
- [ ] Force completion autonomously
